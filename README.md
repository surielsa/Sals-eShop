# Bamazon Customer

In this activity, I created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills I learned this unit. 
The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 


I created the database below and added the values to the table manually.

Then I create the js file that would use the database table information
